The VE introduce SocialBuzz, a small company that specializes in social media and content creation. They have large amount of data coming through everyday
that needs to be analyzed. My part here is to conclude what are the top categories based on the provided datasets.

I chose 3 datasets; Content to aggregate the overall content and Reactions to determine each reaction on each content type, then ReactionTypes so I can quantify 
the reactions.

Here I clean, join and reshape the data using SQL, in order for it to be usable in Tableau.
Then I draw insights and information into an interactive dashboard to present for stakeholders 

This is Task 2 & 3,  the same dashboard could be used for Task 4.
